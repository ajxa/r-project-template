### Explanation of Directory Structure

1. **Data**:
   - **`data/`**: The main directory for storing datasets.
     - **`.gitkeep`**: A placeholder file to ensure the `data/` directory is tracked by Git even if it is empty. This can be removed or replaced as needed.
     - **`raw/`**: A subdirectory intended for raw, unprocessed data files.
     - **`processed/`**: A subdirectory for data that has been processed and is ready for analysis.

2. **Scripts**:
   - **`scripts/`**: A directory to store all R scripts used in the project.
     - **`utils/`**: A subdirectory for utility scripts, which are helper functions or scripts used across the project.
       - **`renv_init.R`**: A script to initialize the `renv` environment, ensuring that all necessary packages are installed and configured correctly.

3. **Outputs**:
   - **`outputs/`**: This directory is intended for storing outputs generated by the project, such as figures, reports, and other results.
     - **`.gitkeep`**: A placeholder file to ensure the `outputs/` directory is tracked by Git even if it is empty. This can be removed or replaced as needed.

4. **Installation and External Resources**:
   - **`inst/`**: This directory is intended for installation scripts or external resources that are part of the project.

5. **Git and Project Configuration Files**:
   - **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked.
   - **`README.md`**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to set up and use it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **R** (version X.X.X or higher)
- **RStudio** (recommended for creating and managing R projects)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository and version control)

### Steps to Clone and Set Up the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/r-project-template.git new_project_name
   cd new_project_name
   ```
   Replace your_username with your GitHub username and new_project_name with the desired name of your new project.

2. **Create an RStudio Project File (.RProj)**:
   
   - Open RStudio and create a new R project in the cloned directory:
   - Go to File > New Project > Existing Directory.
   - Navigate to the cloned new_project_name directory and select it.
   - Name the project appropriately (e.g., new_project_name.Rproj).
   - Click "Create Project"

   This will create a .RProj file in the root directory, which is used to manage RStudio-specific settings.

3. **Initialize an `renv` Environment (optional but encouraged):**
   
   To set up the R package environment and dependencies, run `scripts/utils/renv_init.R` which will:
   
   - Set up the renv project infrastructure in the current directory.
   - Discover and install the R packages that are currently being used in your project into the project-specific library.
   - Create a renv.lock file that records the state of the project library, ensuring that others can restore the same environment.
   - Restart R (if running inside RStudio) to ensure that the new environment is properly loaded.

4. **You're Ready to Go!**

   Once you've completed these steps, your new project should be set up and ready to use. You can now start adding data, scripts, and other resources to the project and begin your analysis.

## Pushing the Project to a New Remote Repository on GitHub

Once you have cloned this template project into a new directory (e.g., `test_project`) and made the necessary changes, follow the steps below to push your project to a new remote repository on GitHub.

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
2. Click on the **"New repository"** button (you can find this by clicking on the "+" icon in the top-right corner or on your GitHub profile page).
3. **Name your new repository** (e.g., `test_project`).
4. Set the repository to **public or private** depending on your preference.
5. **Do not initialize with a README** (since you already have one).
6. Click **"Create repository"**.

### 2. Link Your Local Directory to the New GitHub Repository

After creating the new repository on GitHub, link your local `test_project` directory to this remote repository:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/test_project
    ```

2. Remove the existing remote origin (if any):

    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    ```

3. Add the new remote repository URL:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/test_project.git
    ```

    Replace `your_username` with your GitHub username and `test_project.git` with the name of your new repository.

### 3. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

Push your local changes to the new remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
