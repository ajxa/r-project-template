### Explanation of Directory Structure

1. **Data**:
   - **`data/`**: The main directory for storing datasets.
     - **`.gitkeep`**: A placeholder file to ensure the `data/` directory is tracked by Git even if it is empty. This can be removed or replaced as needed.
     - **`raw/`**: A subdirectory intended for raw, unprocessed data files.
     - **`processed/`**: A subdirectory for data that has been processed and is ready for analysis.

2. **Scripts**:
   - **`scripts/`**: A directory to store all R scripts used in the project.
     - **`utils/`**: A subdirectory for utility scripts, which are helper functions or scripts used across the project.
       - **`renv_init.R`**: A script to initialize the `renv` environment, ensuring that all necessary packages are installed and configured correctly.

3. **Outputs**:
   - **`outputs/`**: This directory is intended for storing outputs generated by the project, such as figures, reports, and other results.
     - **`.gitkeep`**: A placeholder file to ensure the `outputs/` directory is tracked by Git even if it is empty. This can be removed or replaced as needed.

4. **Installation and External Resources**:
   - **`inst/`**: This directory is intended for installation scripts or external resources that are part of the project.

5. **Git and Project Configuration Files**:
   - **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked.
   - **`README.md`**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to set up and use it.
